# So Bee It!

Welcome to the repository for our  [Cocos2d-x](https://cocos2d-x.org/) based mobile game.

'So Bee It' is a simulation game, playable only in  German, about of keeping your own bees and tending to their needs.
The goal is to earn as much money as possible and to keep growing and expanding your colonies.

All interactions with the game are via touch, , the game should be simple enough to be enjoyed by all age groups.

## Installation

There is a folder called "deploy" that includes an unsigned .apk for use with android devices. Functionality has been tested for Android 6.x-9.0 devices, but it should be compatible with devices running 3.0.0 or higher that have at least HD resolution.

## Developing

1. Install the Cocos2d-x framework, we will assume you followed the [tutorial on GitHub](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x) 
2. Download NDK, SDK, JRE seperately or use Android Studio (all of us went through this route) to handle and track dependencies and ease the troubleshooting process
3. Any IDE can be used, but we recommend CLion if on Unix system, Android Studio for Windows and Mac

If all went well, you should be able to use Cocos2d-x specific functions and make changes to our code. In case of issues or questions, head on over to their [GitBook documentation](https://docs.cocos2d-x.org/cocos2d-x/en/)
For specific coding questions, either the [api-ref](https://docs.cocos2d-x.org/api-ref/) is great, or alternatively you can search the [forums](https://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/) 

## Troubleshooting

Your IDE of choice should return the usual mistakes in your code, but at times it may refer to Cocos2d-x base classes, which means that you either made a mistake in logic that Cocos2d-x can't handle or you tried to do something that Cocos2d-x can't handle, in 99% of cases it's the first ;-)
